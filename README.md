# GBOL

The Glasgow Business Oriented Language. 

An [ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule) COBOL. I've done my best, and my best is "eh, that'll do".

In case you've read this far, you deserve to know that 'Glasgow' comes from
the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) used in the implementation. Yes, I know, if 
I have to explain the joke perhaps it's not a good joke. Once again, I've done my best.
